There are time when you need to run a particular script every few minutes, hours or even days, its usually straight forward for seconds, but for hours or days, it isn't.

I am writing the example code on how to make something work every few hours, in my case it was to tweet. Thanks to Ajith N N who helped me to make sense of the entire logic.
